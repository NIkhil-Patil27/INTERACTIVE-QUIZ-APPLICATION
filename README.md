## Description of the Task: Building an Interactive Quiz Application Using JavaScript
The task involves developing an interactive quiz application with the core goal of allowing users to answer questions related to a particular topic—in this case, Shivaji 
Maharaj. The application needs to offer dynamic loading of questions, instant feedback on answers, and scoring functionality. In the end, the user should be able to see 
their score and optionally retry the quiz.


# HTML (Structure):
The application’s user interface is created using HTML. It includes the structure for displaying the questions, multiple choice answers, a feedback section to show 
whether  the user’s answer was correct or wrong, and a score display area.
The HTML also contains a button for progressing through the quiz questions and another button to restart the quiz after completion.

# CSS (Styling):
CSS is used to style the interface, ensuring that the quiz is visually appealing. The design is kept simple, focusing on clarity and user experience.
Responsive design principles are implemented to ensure that the quiz works well across different screen sizes, providing users with a seamless experience whether they
are on a desktop or a mobile device.

# JavaScript (Logic):

JavaScript is used to handle the core functionality of the quiz application. The logic includes:
Loading questions dynamically: The quiz presents a series of questions that are stored in a JavaScript array. Each question includes the question text, multiple choice
options, and the index of the correct answer.
User Interaction: When a user selects an answer, JavaScript checks if it is correct, updates the score, and gives instant feedback.
Progression and Scoring: The app keeps track of the user’s score and allows the user to move to the next question after answering, displaying the current score along
the way.
Result: Once all questions are answered, the application displays the user’s final score and allows the option to retry the quiz.

# Editor
To develop this quiz application, the choice of editor is flexible, but a code editor that supports web development is recommended. Some of the most popular editors and
IDEs for web development include:
Visual Studio Code (VS Code): One of the most widely used, open-source, and highly customizable code editors. It comes with useful extensions, such as live server 
support, syntax highlighting for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and debugging tools.

# Use Cases
Educational Platforms: This quiz application is ideal for educational purposes. Schools or online courses can use it to teach students about Shivaji Maharaj or any 
other historical or educational subject. It can be integrated into learning management systems (LMS) as part of an interactive study module. Additionally, quizzes like
this can be used to test students’ understanding after completing a lesson, and instant feedback helps learners identify areas where they need improvement.
